(this class)

JMenu - for application with proper taskbar, drop-down menu, etc
        put in menu groups, menu items, etc
        window or frame may have several menus
        inherits the JMenuItem class

JSlider - analog input: volume control, media player
          focus order: whether something will always be in focus or if it will never be in focus
          by mouse or keyboard

JColorChooser - rare, unless paint-like application
                specific colors, 100s of apps in photoshop / texteditor
                see and choose colors

JEditorPane - panels inside which you can place multiple other things
              like a container component
              panel is a component inside mother component

JTextPane

JFileChooser - helps to choose a file

JTable - used to display tabular data;
         can select columns, select rows, sorting table, etc
         when we have record data - data that can be displayed as a set of tuples

JTextArea (multi-line text) - scroll bar will come, and correspondingly, text can be written
                              can be put inside a table - used with large amount of data
JTextField (single-line text)

JTree - to give a tree view of files inside directory

JLabel - area where text and image can be given

JProgressBar - like a slider, but cannot be interacted with
               whatever percentage is coming, it will be rendered in the progress bar
               rendering needs thread or something

JSeparator - general purpose component for implementing divider lines
             used to draw a line to separate widgets in a Layout

JToolTip - seen only if slow, if hovered
           hint shown as to what the thing you are hovering over does

JDialog - pop-up with a yes/no question or cancel option or even just information
          has text; there are even some in-built dialogues

JFrame - thing into which whatever you are are writing goes in

JPanel - organizational box
         similar to a div

JScrollPane - scrollable view of a component
              when screen size is limited, we use a scroll pane to display a large component or a component whose size can change dynamically

JSplitPane - used to divide 2 components based on the look and feel implementation
             can be resized by the user
             if minimum size of the 2 components is > split pane size, the divider will not allow you to resize it

             the 2 components in a split pane can be aligned left to right using JSplitPane.HORIZONTAL_SPLIT,
             or top to bottom using JSplitPane.VERTICAL_SPLIT
             when user is resizing components, the minimum size of the components is used to determine the maximum/minimum position the components can be set to

JTabbedPane - used to switch between a group of components by clicking on a tab with a given title or icon
              inherits JComponent class

JToolBar - allows us to group other components, usually buttons with icons in a row or column
           provides a component which is useful for displaying commonly used actions or controls
