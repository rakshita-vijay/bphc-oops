private constructor: used to realize the concept of singleton class

inherited stuff cannot be more restrictive
we can increase the scope, but we can't reduce it
                    (a secret can be shared with more people, but we cannot reduce the number of people who know)

native: can write platform-specific code

null: indicates a reference that does not refer to anything
