mediator:

memento (interpreter): behavioral design pattern used to capture and restore internal object state without exposing implementation details
                       without violating encapsulation to capture and externalize an object's internal state so that it can be restored later

observer: mostly inbuilt
          behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (subject) changes state, all dependents (observers) are notified and are updated accordingly

state: observer is the object itself
       alters behavious when internal state changes

strategy: talking about facade
          depending on need we can go to one of the many implementations
