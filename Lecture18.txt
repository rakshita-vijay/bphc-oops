mediator: reduces communication complexity between multiple objects / classes

memento (interpreter): behavioural design pattern used to capture and restore internal object state without exposing implementation details
                       without violating encapsulation to capture and externalize an object's internal state so that it can be restored later

observer: mostly inbuilt
          behavioural design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (subject) changes state, all dependents (observers) are notified and are updated accordingly

      state: observer is the object itself
             alters behaviour when internal state changes

strategy: talking about facade
          depending on need we can go to one of the many implementations

iterator: access objects in sequential order without need to know internal implementation
